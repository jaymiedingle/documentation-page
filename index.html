                            Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the way back to 18th century in Naples, Italy.
                            During this time, the poorer citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased food that was cheap and could be eaten quickly. 
                            Luckily for them, Neapolitan pizza was affordable and readily available through numerous street vendors.

                        <p>
                            The typical Neapolitan pizza toppings are fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil leaves, oregano, and olive oil. 
                            Since Neapolitan pizza is thin, it isn't designed to handle the weight of too many toppings. 
                            In fact, Neapolitan pizza is so thin that it's typically eaten with a fork and knife.

                            Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its name from the city it was invented in. 
                            During the early 1900’s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for something similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. 
                            Instead of imitating the notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in mind. 
                            He created a pizza with a thick crust that had raised edges, similar to a pie, and ingredients in reverse, with slices of mozzarella lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then topped with a can of crushed tomatoes. 
                            This original creation led Sewell to create the now famous chain restaurant, Pizzeria Uno.

                            In order to easily get a Chicago pizza out of the pan, it's important to wipe the pan down with oil. 
                            Adding oil to the pan also helps to make the base of the dough a bit crispier. 
                            Since there are more toppings and dough, baking a deep dish pizza can be a lengthier process, with a baking time of 30 - 35 minutes.

                            With its characteristic large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust, New York-style pizza is one of America’s most famous regional pizza types. 
                            Originally a variation of Neapolitan-style pizza, the New York slice has taken on a fame all its own, with some saying its unique flavor has to do with the minerals present in New York’s tap water supply.

                            Just like the Neapolitan pizza, many will tell you that in order for a New York-style pizza to be authentic, it has to be cooked in a wood or coal burning oven. 
                            Today, many people use gas deck ovens to bake them, which creates the same delicious and crispy result.

                            Sicilian pizza, also known as "sfincione," provides a thick cut of pizza with pillowy dough, a crunchy crust, and robust tomato sauce. This square-cut pizza is served with or without cheese, and often with the cheese underneath the sauce to prevent the pie from becoming soggy. 
                            Sicilian pizza was brought to America in the 19th century by Sicilian immigrants and became popular in the United States after the Second World War.

                            To bring out the flavor of your Sicilian pizza dough, try lining your pan with an olive oil blend. The temperature of your oven will determine how long you should bake your pie. 
                            For example, if your oven is heated to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, it should take about 15 - 20 minutes to bake your Sicilian pizza.

                            Greek pizza was created by Greek immigrants who came to America and were introduced to Italian pizza. Greek-style pizza, especially popular in the New England states, features a thick and chewy crust cooked in shallow, oiled pans, resulting in a nearly deep-fried bottom. 
                            While this style has a crust that is puffier and chewier than thin crust pizzas, it’s not quite as thick as a deep-dish or Sicilian crust.

                            California pizza, or gourmet pizza, is known for its unusual ingredients. 
                            This pizza got its start back in the late 1970’s when Chef Ed LaDou began experimenting with pizza recipes in the classic Italian restaurant, Prego. He created a pizza with mustard, ricotta, pate, and red pepper, and by chance, served it to Wolfgang Puck. Impressed with LaDou’s innovative pie, Puck invited him to be a head pizza chef at his restaurant. 
                            It was here that LaDou came up with over 250 unique pizza recipes that eventually formed the menu of the chain restaurant California Pizza Kitchen.

                            Reflecting the city’s deep ties to the auto industry, Detroit-style pizza was originally baked in a square automotive parts pan in the 1940’s. Detroit pizza is first topped with pepperoni, followed by brick cheese which is spread to the very edges of the pan, yielding a caramelized cheese perimeter. Sauce is then spooned over the pizza, an order similar to Chicago-style pizza. 
                            This pizza features a thick, extra crispy crust that is tender and airy on the inside.

                            Use a specialized Detroit pan or a traditional jelly roll baking pan. 
                            Press the air out from the dough while pushing dough to the edges of the pan; stretch the dough up the sides about half of an inch. Make sure to spread the cheese generously across the dough and to the edges for a caramelized perimeter. Cook at the highest temperature setting (500 to 550 degrees Fahrenheit) for 10-15 minutes. 
                            Cut your slices in squares!

                            Looking for a light slice? St. Louis pizza features a thin crust with a cracker-like consistency that is made without yeast. 
                            Due to the crispy crust, St. Louis pizza is usually cut into three- or four-inch rectangles, known as "party" or "tavern" cut. 
                            This pizza features Provel processed cheese, which is a gooey combination of cheddar, Swiss, and provolone cheeses. St. Louis received an influx of Italian immigrants in the 19th century who were looking for employment opportunities. The Italian community, largely from Milan and Sicily, created the St. Louis-style pizza. 
                            Its sweet sauce is reminiscent of the Sicilian influence.
